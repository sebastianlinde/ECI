# Economic Complexity Index (ECI)
The ECI package allows you to comute the economic complexity index for any bi-partite network configuration.  This code was used in the project: **Li, Linde and Shimao (2018), *Major to Occupation Networks: The Importance of Specificity*, Mimeo.**  If you use this package we ask that you please cite the above work.
